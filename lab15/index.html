      <h1>Lab 15 - Basic Debugging</h1>
      <h2>Challenge</h2>
      <p>For this lab, we went back and debugged any previous labs that needed debugging.</p>
      <h2>Problems</h2>
      <p>I had two labs that needed debugging, and luckily things went really well. my first try at solving the problem was successful for both labs.</p>
      <h2>Results</h2>
      <p>The results are below in the debugging section!</p>
      <h2>Debugging</h2>
      <h3>Lab 10</h3>
      <img src="img/lab10debug.png" width=500>
      <p>For lab 10 I was having an issue with my button not working at all. I was able to figure it out after looking at working code, I had an error in my javscript.</p>
      <h3>Lab 12</h3>
      <img src="img/lab12debug.png" width=500>
      <p>For Lab 12 my button worked but it only applied to the "challenge" section, when it was also supposed to apply to "Problems" and "Results" as well. I decided to try to give each section its own unique id and call all 3 seperate ids in javascript and it worked perfectly.</p>
